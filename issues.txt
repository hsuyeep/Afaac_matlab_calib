Issue list for aartfaac calibration and imaging:

Visibility processing optimization
----------------------------------
- What is the distribution of baselines/visibilities in spatial freq, for the 
  various operating modes of the AARTFAAC? 
- Can we average 'closeby' visibilities together to reduce computation and
  increase SNR?
- Can we eliminate some visibilities without losing too much calibration 
  solution SNR or image dynamic range?

Phase calibration for ionospheric distortions using WSF
-----------------------------------------------
- What is the error on the WSF positions?
- What happens if we do not use the WSF at all, but a more accurate sky-model, 
  say from the VLSS?
- What is the effect of not correcting a position error of model sources by 
  a few PSF widths? ie, what are the phase errors introduced, and does this 
  have an implication on deciding the working calibration unit?
- What is the effect of multiple rounds of WSF, with a better calibration in 
  each iteration? (Since WSF is sensitive to array calibration). What if in 
  tracking calibration we first calibrate the array using a prev. solution 
  before WSF?
- What is the effect of instantaneous RFI on WSF? (As the signal model assumes 
  spatial incoherence of the emitters, so that the array manifold is 
  unambiguous.)
- How strong does an emitter have to be for WSF to converge? Can we extend it
  to weaker sources? Say the LOFAR calibrators?
- How long can we coast on WSF solutions? 
- What is the effect of feed-forward of WSF estimates to next timeslice on the
  calibration solutions of that timeslice?

- What is the convergence rate of WSF with NM fminsearch?
- 

Amplitude calibration
---------------------
- Is there a correlation between antenna gain amplitude estimates and extracted
  fluxes of the model sources?

Flagging
--------
- What is the fraction of data which is being flagged currently as a function of
  subband, and what are the most common errors?

- How do low level RFI features behave on calibration? Is there a need for post 
  calibration flagging?
- Can insight be gained into flagging by looking at neighbouring channels as 
  well? ie, do we need to couple flagging info across the spectra?

Overall calibration
-------------------
- What is the effect of bright transients/instantaneous RFI on the calibration?
- Can we see the effect of the ionosphere on generated images, say via image 
  wander? or amplitude scintillations?
- What about applying average calibration solutions to instantaneous 
  visibilities?
- How does calibratability change as a function of time and bandwidth smearing?
  ie, what is the calibration unit to choose for the AARTFAAC?
- What is the overall effect of the frequency axis on calibration solutions?
- How independent of frequency is the calibration, can each calibration unit be 
  treated completely independently?
- What is the role of polarization within the ASM's operational boundaries?

- What is the rate of divergence of calibration solutions from a given point 
  in time? This should change slowly, at rates corresponding to instrumental 
  and sky variations.
- Is it better to calibrate several 3 KHz chunks of the spectrum, average the
  calibrated visibilities, and then create a single image? Or calibrate and 
  image at 3 KHz, and then average the images? Or is it better to average the 
  uncalibrated visibilities, carry out a single calibration at higher SNR, and 
  image at the integrated spectral resolution?
- What about generating total intensity images? Currently, we calibrate the XX
  correlations only, but for I images, we'll need XX+YY. How do the YY images 
  look?
- What is the dynamic range of images generated using only 3 KHz of bandwidth?
  Is it better to calibrate at high spectral resolution and then integrate over
  frequency?
  


Tracking calibration
--------------------
- In what fraction of timeslices do we actually have to do a convergent 
  calibration? How effective is tracking calibration in practice?
- Under different observing conditions, what are the adequate number of 
  iterations to carry out to ensure a specified calibration error?
- what is the effect of low level RFI on the solution propagation in trackcal?
- What is the best criteria for establishing the goodness of a solution in a 
  pipelined manner? Currently looking at estimated gain phase MSE. See Kazemi
  SAGECal description paper.


Imaging
-------
- What is the effect of various imaging parameters on calibrated AARTFAAC 
  visibilities? Try with CASA imager using different settings.
- Facetted imaging: Do we do that as routine? Is w-projection a better way to
  get high sensitivity image edges? (see w-proj. paper by cornwell).
- What should be the pixel spacing for all-sky imaging? currently we go slightly
  over nyquist...
- Is there any requirement for A-projection, considering sources are still 
  moving through the sidelobes. Maybe since we are making snapshot images, 
  things are still fine, but what if we want to stack images for sensitivity?
- What kind of weighting of the visibilities is suitable for point source 
  detection from the AARTFAAC?
- What kind of gridding does a suitable interpolation for AARTFAAC visibilities?
  What is the effect of the high UV sampling density on chosen interpolation 
  schemes?
- What are the implications of stacking images over frequency to generate higher
  sensitivity images?

Source extraction
-----------------
- What is the stability of extracted fluxes of the brightest sources in the 
  observed sky? Do any systematic variations correlate with gain estimations?
- What is the region from which one can reliably extract sources?

Observation simulations
-----------------------
- How does one add noise to a simulation for a specified per-dipole sensitivity?
- 

Noise analysis
--------------
- Given the sensitivities of antennas and the sky temprature at a given time 
  (sky background + bright sources within FoV), what is the expected increase 
  in noise due to 4-bit representation for the complex subbands?
- How does the calibration distribute non-modelable effects to the noise 
  estimates? Specifically see this under day time conditions.
- How does the noise estimation vary as a function of frequency?
- What is the contribution of confusion noise for different observing 
  configurations?
- What is hte contribution of self noise from the A-team sources to the image?
  what about after A-team subtraction (see Anantha's paper), do we need to do 
  anything special to handle the excess noise left over after src removal?

Galactic modelling:
-------------------
- For spatial filtering of the galaxy, what is the visibility cutoff under 
  different observing conditions? Should this be adapted to different observing 
  conditions?
- What is the computational load of shapelet analysis of the galaxy?
- What is the error in the shapelet analysis, and do we still need to carry out
  a spatial filtering of the galaxy after a shapelet representation?
- How can modeling errors be quantified? Can they be tested using simulations?

Commensal observations with LOFAR
---------------------------------
- How does one communicate the change of modes in LOFAR, which affect our 
  observations, and do we have to do anything to account for it?
- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation issues:
---------------------
- Separation of flagging mask from spatial filtering mask.
